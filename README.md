maxmind-ipgeolocate-google-maps-with-directions
===============================================

A mash-up I created using MaxMind IP Geolocation and Google Maps to deliver automatic driving directions and maps from the visitor's approximate location to a destination of your choosing. 

## Pre-requisites:
  - A Google Maps API key.
  - A Agreement to MaxMind Terms of Service.

## History
I built this out during the construction of an auto-body dealership client's website. 

## Customization
This script was originally designed using Google Maps v2, it can be adapted to work with v3 with little or no customization. A similar API exists for other driving direction services, such as Bing Maps, OpenStreetMaps, MapQuest, and many many others.
In principal, the steps which result in the return of a latitude and longitude based on an IP-address are universal and can be adapted in any number of ways to suite your needs.
